Grunt project template with:

 - Class.js
 - underscore (1.5)
 - reactjs (0.8)
 - fontawesome (4.x)

Also contains minimal version of twitter bootstrap (3.x); only grid, forms,
fonts settings, reset and some of the other basic utilities are included.
Having too much twbs in the project leads to style/design stagnation.

All packages are included in sources/lib, use of an automated update system for
the included packages is discouraged. It's much safer to update manually; and
some may only be updated manually as-is.
