See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

Grunt project template for prototyping:

 - *Class.js* - javascript classes
 - *lodash* (2.4.1) - fork of underscore (mostly compatible syntax)
 - *oboe* (1.14.2) - javascript streaming ajax library
 - *reactjs* (0.10) - frontend rending library
 - *page* (1.x) - frontend routing library
 - *snap.svg* (0.2.0) - frontend svg library
 - *fontawesome* (4.1) - font icon goodness
 - *nodejs express server*

You also have a complete demo of a _basic forum application_ setup to
illustrate how how things would be organized (also because copy paste is
faster for prototyping work).

All packages are included in sources/dependencies, use of an automated update
system for the included packages is discouraged. It's much safer to update
manually; and some may only be updated manually as-is.
